# Console-Tasks-Manager
######### Console Based TaskManager ##########

THE TASKS MANAGER WORKS WITH FILES! Files are saved in / PhoneBook\bin\Debug /

To play with app you need to hardcore the first user in the users.txt file which will be created when you try to run the app and write random username and password or just add users.txt in the DEBUG folder above.

-TIP- To add user you need to enter in users.txt file ID, username, password, name and isAdmin on the separate lines !

THE Tasks Manager is more complicated than my other consoled based app ( Simple-Console-Phone-Book )
- Generic Repository and View !
- Enum
- Much more complicated logic (comments and loggedWork)

In the app the main logic is placed in the View
because we use the console if you want to se the
MVC architecture check my others projects.
